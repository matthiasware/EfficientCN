% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle
\section{Passagen und Templates}
The original work~\cite{nips/SabourFH17} gives a clear conceptual motivation, namely parsing objects in images into a part-whole hierarchy.
From this, the CapsNet model architecture is deduced and many hypothetical benefits are attributed to this ability.
We believe this is the fundamental issue, that makes CapsNets actually hard.
	
Inflated usage.
Vagueness of the definition
\begin{itemize}
	\item From a conceptual perspective: The idea of Hinton. Parse Tree. Why do people want this? Interpretable
	\item From a technical perspective: Various implementations and advancements. Lots of technical stuff but a lack af ablation studies and general vagueness of the definition.
\end{itemize}
