### Install:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
### Todo
- check hyperparameter
- preprocessing!
- check calculations!
- check attention scores
- add SmallNORBS example
- add MultiMNIST example


### Questions

#### MNIST
- what is my best baseline?
- how do attention scores look like?
- how do attention scores vary over training process?
- training without augementation?
- how to speedup training?
- can i get the same results as in the paper?
